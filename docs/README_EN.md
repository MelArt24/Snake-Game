## Snake game

Snake Game is a classic arcade game. We all played it in our childhood or at some later stage in life.

This repository contains my implementation of this game.

First, we start the game. We will see the main menu, which looks like this. Here, we can choose either to play the game or exit.

Next, if you choose to play, you can select a color.

After selecting the color, the game will start.

With every level-up, we receive additional food (marked in yellow).

There are only two ways to end the game: either throw your computer out of a tenth-floor window or create a situation where the snake crashes into itself. In the second scenario, we will see a menu with the text "Game Over" and the score we achieved. Here, we also have two options: either exit the game or restart it.
